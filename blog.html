      It's incredible how much students learn during Module One at Turing. The first module focuses on Ruby and Object Oriented Programming. In order to get a good handle on these subjects in only six weeks, it is expected that you pick up new concepts at a rapid pace. This combined with being new to programming leads to writing a lot of crappy code. This in turn leads to bugs in your software. One of the most useful tools I learned how to use that helped me fix my bugs was <strong>pry</strong>.
      Pry is a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) which creates an interactive programming environment that takes a user's input,evaluates it and returns the result to the user. It is very similiar to IRB but has the added value of being able to be injected into your program. Utilizing the <em>binding</em> class throughout your code allows you to essentially freeze your program at points specified by you, so you can find out the exact values of variables, methods etc. within specific scopes.
      Pry allowed me to identify and correct a lot of bugs in my code on my own and allowed me to learn at a faster pace. If there's a bug in your program and you're lost on how to fix it <strong>pry into it</strong>! You may just be able to figure it out on your own.
